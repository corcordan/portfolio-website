            <p>Hi, I&aposm Daniel Corcoran, a recent graduate from Christopher Newport University with a degree in Computer Science and minors in Business Administration and Leadership Studies. I graduated Cum Laude in the Honors Program and am passionate about AI/ML, Data Science, and software development. I&aposm excited to start my career and explore opportunities in Software Engineering, Data Engineering, or AI Engineering.</p>

            <p>Throughout my time at CNU, I was involved in leadership roles like serving as VP of Member Development for my fraternity, Sigma Phi Epsilon, where I led a team and honed skills in planning, delegation, and communication. I was also a Student Ambassador and had the chance to participate in a study abroad program, further expanding my leadership perspective.</p>

            <p>I&aposve worked on several projects, including StudyGo, an academic social media platform, and a Snake Reinforcement Learning agent, using Deep Q-learning to optimize gameplay. My technical skills include proficiency in Python, SQL/MySQL, Java, R, and frameworks like PyTorch, scikit-learn, and Keras.</p>

            <p>In addition to my technical expertise, I&aposm a strong communicator, a critical thinker, and enjoy working in teams. Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, playing the piano, and love spending time at the ocean.</p>

            <p>I&aposm excited about the future and eager to contribute to innovative projects while continuing to grow both professionally and personally.</p>
